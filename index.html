                    A snail is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod. The name is
                    most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate
                    gastropod molluscs. However, the common name snail is also
                    used for most of the members of the molluscan class
                    Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for
                    the animal to retract completely into. When the word "snail"
                    is used in this most general sense, it includes not just
                    land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and
                    freshwater snails.

                    Snails can be found in a very wide range of environments,
                    including ditches, deserts, and the abyssal depths of the
                    sea. Although land snails may be more familiar to laymen,
                    marine snails constitute the majority of snail species, and
                    have much greater diversity and a greater biomass. Numerous
                    kinds of snail can also be found in fresh water.

                    Snails feed at night. Most terrestrial snails are
                    herbivorous, but others are omnivorous and some even
                    carnivorous. You will likely find snails around your garden
                    as this offers them plenty of fresh plants and leaves to
                    eat. The herbivorous snails devour a wide variety of live
                    plant parts: leaves, stems, plant crops, bark, and fruits.
                    Many consume fungi and mushrooms, and others may
                    occasionally add algae, although these are an important food
                    for freshwater snails.
