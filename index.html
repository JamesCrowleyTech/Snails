                        A snail is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod. The
                        name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial
                        pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name
                        snail is also used for most of the members of the
                        molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that
                        is large enough for the animal to retract completely
                        into. When the word "snail" is used in this most general
                        sense, it includes not just land snails but also
                        numerous species of sea snails and freshwater
                        snails.They carry their home on their back for
                        protection, so they can stop to sleep wherever they
                        happen to be (decorations, tank walls, leaves, or the
                        substrate). Their bed is wherever they want it.

                        Snails can be found in a very wide range of
                        environments, including ditches, deserts, and the
                        abyssal depths of the sea. Although land snails may be
                        more familiar to laymen, marine snails constitute the
                        majority of snail species, and have much greater
                        diversity and a greater biomass. Numerous kinds of snail
                        can also be found in fresh water.Some people assume that
                        snails do not live in the desert, but that isn’t true.
                        The terrestrial gastropods are the only mollusks that
                        have adapted to all the habitats of the Earth. They
                        dwell in areas of high altitude, mountainous regions,
                        hot and cold places.

                        Snails feed at night. Snails have evolved to eat just
                        about everything. Most terrestrial snails are
                        herbivorous, but others are omnivorous and some even
                        carnivorous. You will likely find snails around your
                        garden as this offers them plenty of fresh plants and
                        leaves to eat. The herbivorous snails devour a wide
                        variety of live plant parts: leaves, stems, plant crops,
                        bark, and fruits. Many consume fungi and mushrooms, and
                        others may occasionally add algae, although these are an
                        important food for freshwater snails.
